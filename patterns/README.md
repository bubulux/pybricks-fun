# Pattern Documentation Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation of the educational patterns used in the Pybricks programming curriculum. These patterns ensure consistency, quality, and effective learning across all course materials.

## Pattern Files

### 1. [Course Article Structure](./course-article-structure.md)
Defines the overall structure and flow for main instructional articles (`index.mdx` files).

**Key Elements:**
- Header and meta information
- Progressive content organization
- Interactive learning elements
- Summary and connection patterns
- Target audience considerations

**Reference:** `course/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/index.mdx`

### 2. [Task Structure](./task-structure.md)
Defines the organization and format for practice exercises (`tasks.mdx` files).

**Key Elements:**
- 24 total tasks per topic (6 per difficulty level)
- 3 implement + 3 predict tasks per difficulty
- Progressive complexity across Easy/Medium/Hard/Challenge
- Image requirements for different task types

**Reference:** `course/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/tasks.mdx`

### 3. [Solution Structure](./solution-structure.md)
Defines the format and explanation style for solution guides (`solutions.mdx` files).

**Key Elements:**
- Step-by-step solution explanations
- Educational code commentary
- Visual block representations
- Concept reinforcement strategies

**Reference:** `course/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/solutions.mdx`

### 4. [Image Requirements](./image-requirements.md)
Comprehensive guidelines for visual elements accompanying all code examples.

**Key Elements:**
- Every code block requires an accompanying image
- Specific naming conventions (PRED-X.Y.png, SOL-X.Y.png)
- Placement rules and sizing guidelines
- Quality and content standards

### 5. [Educational Tone](./educational-tone.md)
Defines the consistent voice, style, and communication approach used throughout the curriculum.

**Key Elements:**
- Age-appropriate language for middle/high school students
- Encouraging, conversational tone
- Interactive question patterns
- Analogy and metaphor guidelines
- Robotics context integration

## Usage Guidelines

### For Course Content Creation
1. **Start with structure**: Use course-article-structure.md as template
2. **Apply tone guidelines**: Follow educational-tone.md for voice consistency
3. **Add images properly**: Follow image-requirements.md for all visuals
4. **Create practice tasks**: Use task-structure.md for exercise design
5. **Develop solutions**: Follow solution-structure.md for explanations

### For Content Review
- Cross-reference against all relevant patterns
- Ensure consistency with established examples
- Verify image requirements are met
- Check tone and voice alignment
- Validate structural organization

### For AI Agent Instructions
These patterns serve as comprehensive instructions for AI agents working on curriculum content:

```
Please follow the educational patterns documented in /patterns/ directory:
- Use course-article-structure.md for main article organization
- Follow educational-tone.md for voice and style
- Apply image-requirements.md for all visual elements
- Reference existing examples as indicated in each pattern
```

## Pattern Evolution

### Maintaining Consistency
- All new content should follow established patterns
- Any pattern changes should be documented and applied retroactively
- Regular review ensures patterns remain current and effective

### Quality Assurance
- Patterns provide objective criteria for content evaluation
- Consistency across different authors and contributors
- Scalable approach for curriculum expansion

### Continuous Improvement
- Patterns evolve based on educational effectiveness
- Student feedback and learning outcomes inform updates
- Best practices from educational research integrated over time

# 1.2.2.3 Numbers - Solutions

--

## Easy

### Implement

#### 1. Print two variables — solution and explanation

<img

  alt="Print two variables: a and b"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables
a = 7
b = 13

print(a)
print(b)
```

Explanation:

- We create two variables and assign the numbers 7 and 13 to them.
- `print()` displays the value stored in each variable on its own line.

Expected output:

```
7
13
```

#### 2. Add two numbers and show the result — solution and explanation

<img

  alt="Add two numbers and print the sum"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
x = 4
y = 6

print(x + y)
```

Explanation:

- `x + y` computes the sum of the two variables; `print` shows the result.
- This doesn't change `x` or `y` — it only computes a value and prints it.

Expected output:

```
10
```

#### 3. Subtract and show both values — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-1.3.png"
  alt="Subtraction result and original value"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
m = 20
n = 5

print(m - n)  # prints the subtraction result
print(m)      # prints m again to show it didn't change
```

Explanation:

- `m - n` computes 20 - 5 = 15. We then print `m` to show `m` still holds 20.

Expected output:

```
15
20
```

### Predict — answers and derivations

#### 4. Predict: basic arithmetic — code and derivation

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-1.4.png"
  alt="Predict sum and product of x and y"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# predict the output
x = 2
y = 3
print(x + y)
print(x * y)
```

Step-by-step:

- `x + y` → 2 + 3 = 5
- `x * y` → 2 \* 3 = 6

Predicted output:

```
5
6
```

#### 5. Predict: order of operations — code and derivation

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-1.5.png"
  alt="Order of operations: addition vs multiplication"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
a = 5
b = 2
print((a + b) * 2)
print((a * b) + 2)
```

Step-by-step:

- `(a + b) * 2` forces the addition inside parentheses first:
  - `a + b` → 5 + 2 = 7
  - `7 * 2` → 14
- `(a * b) + 2` forces the multiplication inside parentheses first:
  - `a * b` → 5 \* 2 = 10
  - `10 + 2` → 12

Predicted output:

```
14
12
```

#### 6. Predict: reassign vs. expression — code and derivation

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-1.6.png"
  alt="Reassign vs. expression: print before and after"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
v = 10
print(v)
print(v + 5)
print(v)
```

Step-by-step:

- `v` is 10.
- `print(v)` shows 10.
- `print(v + 5)` computes 10 + 5 = 15, but does not change `v`.
- `print(v)` still shows 10.

Predicted output:

```
10
15
10
```

## Medium

### Implement

#### 1. Average of two numbers — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-2.1.png"
  alt="Average of two numbers (mean)"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
a = 8
b = 12

average = (a + b) / 2
print(average)
```

Explanation:

- `(a + b)` adds the two numbers, then dividing by `2` gives the mean. Division returns a float so the output is `10.0`.

Expected output:

```
10.0
```

#### 2. Add then divide (chained reassign) — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-2.2.png"
  alt="Chained reassign: add then divide"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
value = 9
print(value)

value = value + 11
print(value)

value = value / 4
print(value)
```

Explanation:

- Start: `value = 9` → print 9.
- After `value = value + 11` → 20 → print 20.
- After division `value = value / 4` → 20 / 4 = 5.0 → print 5.0 (float).

Expected output:

```
9
20
5.0
```

#### 3. Random pick within a range — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-2.3.png"
  alt="Random integer between low and high (inclusive)"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
from urandom import randint

low = 1
high = 6
print(randint(low, high))
```

Explanation:

- `randint(low, high)` returns a random integer including both endpoints. Running multiple times gives different outputs between 1 and 6.

Example outputs (will vary):

```
3
6
1
```

### Predict — answers and derivations

#### 4. Predict: chaining arithmetic — code and derivation

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-2.4.png"
  alt="Chaining arithmetic assignments to update n"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
n = 4
n = n * 3
n = n + 2
print(n)
```

Step-by-step:

- Start `n = 4`.
- `n = n * 3` → n becomes 12.
- `n = n + 2` → n becomes 14.
- `print(n)` → 14.

Predicted output:

```
14
```

#### 5. Predict: division and float — code and reasoning

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-2.5.png"
  alt="Division showing float and integer division examples"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
num = 7
print(num / 2)
print(num // 2)  # integer division may not be supported in the simplified editor; think about what the editor expects
```

Step-by-step:

- `num / 2` → 7 / 2 = 3.5 (float) → prints `3.5`.
- `num // 2` is integer (floor) division in full Python, which yields `3`. If your simplified editor doesn't support `//`, omit it; otherwise expect `3`.

Predicted output (standard Python):

```
3.5
3
```

#### 6. Predict: max/min combination — code and reasoning

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-2.6.png"
  alt="Max and min example showing highest and lowest values"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
a = 17
b = 9
print(max(a, b))
print(min(a, b))
```

Step-by-step:

- `max(17, 9)` → 17. `min(17, 9)` → 9.

Predicted output:

```
17
9
```

## Hard

### Implement

#### 1. Nested calculation and round — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-3.1.png"
  alt="Nested calculation with round and addition"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
a = 10

result = round(a / 2) + 5
print(result)
```

Explanation:

- `a / 2` → 10 / 2 = 5.0 → `round(5.0)` = 5 → add 5 → 10.

Expected output:

```
15
```

#### 2. Leaderboard gap — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-3.2.png"
  alt="Leaderboard gap: top, second and difference"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
s1 = 12
s2 = 18
s3 = 15

top = max(s1, s2, s3)
# For second place we can use a simple trick: the second-highest is the maximum of the three values after removing the top.
# One robust approach without lists:
second = max(min(s1, s2), min(max(s1, s2), s3))

needed = top - second
print(top)
print(second)
print(needed)
```

Explanation (brief):

- `top` is the largest value (18).
- `second` calculation picks the next largest (15) using pairwise min/max.
- `needed` is the difference between `top` and `second` → 3.

Expected output:

```
18
15
3
```

#### 3. Reassign and round final — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-3.3.png"
  alt="Reassign value, compute, then round the result"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
value = 7
print(value)

value = (value + 5) * 2
print(value)

value = value / 3
print(round(value))
```

Explanation:

- Start: `7`.
- `(7 + 5) * 2` → `12 * 2` = `24`.
- `24 / 3` = `8.0` → `round(8.0)` = `8`.

Expected output:

```
7
24
8
```

### Predict — answers and detailed derivations

#### 4. Predict: very complex nested assignment (derivation required)

Code (read carefully):

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-3.4.png"
  alt="Complex nested assignment using round and ceil"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
from umath import ceil

a = 11
b = 6
c = 4

# compute several nested expressions and combine them
part1 = round(a / 2) + max(b, c)
part2 = ceil(b / 3) + min(a, c)
final = max(part1 * 2 - 3, part2 + 4) + round((a + b) / c)
print(final)
```

Derivation step-by-step:

1. Compute `round(a / 2)`:

   - `a / 2` = 11 / 2 = 5.5
   - `round(5.5)` → depending on rounding rules this becomes `6` in Python (round halves to nearest even in some versions) — but in educational contexts round(5.5) → 6. We'll use `6`.

2. Compute `max(b, c)`:

   - `max(6, 4)` = 6

3. `part1 = round(a / 2) + max(b, c)`:

   - `part1 = 6 + 6 = 12`

4. Compute `ceil(b / 3)`:

   - `b / 3` = 6 / 3 = 2.0
   - `ceil(2.0)` = 2

5. Compute `min(a, c)`:

   - `min(11, 4)` = 4

6. `part2 = ceil(b / 3) + min(a, c)`:

   - `part2 = 2 + 4 = 6`

7. Compute `part1 * 2 - 3`:

   - `12 * 2 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21`

8. Compute `part2 + 4`:

   - `6 + 4 = 10`

9. `max(part1 * 2 - 3, part2 + 4)`:

   - `max(21, 10)` = 21

10. `round((a + b) / c)`:

- `(a + b) / c` = (11 + 6) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
- `round(4.25)` = 4

11. Final `final = 21 + 4 = 25`.

Predicted output:

```
25
```

Note on rounding: Python's `round()` uses bankers rounding (round to even) for .5 values; `round(5.5)` returns `6` in Python 3, so our use of `6` above is correct.

#### 5. Predict: nested math with reassignment — derivation

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-3.5.png"
  alt="Nested math example where x is reassigned"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
x = 5
x = x * 2 + 3
print(x)
print(x / 4)
```

Derivation:

- Start `x = 5`.
- `x = x * 2 + 3` is evaluated right-hand side first: `5 * 2 + 3` → multiplication first → `10 + 3` = 13. So `x` becomes 13.
- `print(x)` → `13`.
- `print(x / 4)` → `13 / 4 = 3.25`.

Predicted output:

```
13
3.25
```

#### 6. Predict: combine round, max and arithmetic — derivation

Code:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.2-numbers/res/SOL-3.6.png"
  alt="Combine round and max to compute final result"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
a = 5
b = 12
c = 3
result = round((a * b) / c) + max(a, b, c)
print(result)
```

Derivation:

- `a * b` → 5 \* 12 = 60
- `(a * b) / c` → 60 / 3 = 20.0
- `round(20.0)` → 20
- `max(a, b, c)` → max(5, 12, 3) = 12
- `result = 20 + 12 = 32`

Predicted output:

```
32
```

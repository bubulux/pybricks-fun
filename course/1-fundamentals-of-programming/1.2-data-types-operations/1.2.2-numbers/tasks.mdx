# 1.2.2.2 Numbers - Tasks

Below are practice tasks based only on the material covered so far: variables and numbers (basic arithmetic, division/floats, reassigning variables, `max`/`min`/`round`, and `randint`). We'll provide a separate solutions article later — try these on your own first.

Rules:

- The tasks are can be solved with the things you have learned so far.
- You can use everything from the Numbers and Variables sections, even things we didn't explicitly cover
- So for example you could use the custom math function pill or other predefined functions from the second pill
- But you cannot use anything else from other sections (like conditionals, loops etc.)

## Easy — (Practice reading and printing numbers)

### 1. Print two variables

Goal: Create two variables named `a` and `b` that hold the numbers 7 and 13, then display both values so that each appears on its own line.

Hint: You will need a way to define values and a way to show them to the console.

Expected output:

```
7
13
```

### 2. Add two numbers and show the result

Goal: Have two values (4 and 6) and produce their sum on the screen.

Hint: Think about how to combine the two numbers into a single result and then display it.

Expected output:

```
10
```

### 3. Subtract and show both values

Goal: Use two values (20 and 5). First display the result of subtracting the second from the first, then display the original first value again to prove it was not changed by the operation.

Hint: Perform the subtraction and then display both the result and the original variable.

Expected output:

```
15
20
```

### 4. Multiply and divide

Goal: With two numbers (3 and 4), display their product and then the result of dividing the second by the first.

Hint: One result will likely be a decimal number — that's okay.

Expected output:

```
12
1.3333333333333333
```

### 5. Simple reassign

Goal: Start with a value called `score` equal to 5. Increase it by 10 and display the new value; then decrease it by 3 and display the result again.

Hint: Remember that to change a stored value you assign a new value to the same variable name.

Expected output:

```
15
12
```

## Medium — (Using arithmetic in assignments and `randint`)

### 1. Average of two numbers

Goal: Use two stored numbers (8 and 12) to compute their average and display it. The result should be a decimal number.

Hint: Combine the numbers with arithmetic, then make sure to divide appropriately.

Expected output:

```
10.0
```

### 2. Add then divide (chained reassign)

Goal: Begin with a number `value = 9`. Show its value, then increase it by 11 and show it again, then divide the new value by 4 and show the final result.

Hint: Print after each step to show the changes.

Expected output:

```
9
20
5.0
```

### 3. Random pick within a range

Goal: Simulate a dice roll by producing a random integer between 1 and 6. Run your program several times to see different results.

Hint: Use the random integer function available in the lessons; make the range inclusive of both ends.

Expected output: any integer between `1` and `6` (inclusive).

### 4. Find larger and smaller

Goal: Given two values (17 and 9), display the larger and the smaller one.

Hint: Think about how to pick the maximum and minimum values without loops.

Expected output:

```
17
9
```

### 5. Chain arithmetic into assignment

Goal: Start with `n = 4`. Update `n` so that it's multiplied by 3 and then increased by 2; finally display the new `n`.

Hint: Reassign `n` using an expression that uses the previous value of `n`.

Expected output:

```
14
```

## Hard — (Nested operations and combining techniques)

### 1. Nested operations

Goal: With `a = 10` and `b = 20`, compute a result that chooses the larger of two expressions: one expression is the rounded value of `a / 2` plus 5, the other is the rounded or ceilinged value of `b / 3` plus 1. Display the final chosen number and add a short comment explaining the order of operations you used.

Hint: Build each inner calculation first in your head (or in a temporary variable), then combine them with the function that chooses the larger value.

Expected output:

```
15
```

### 2. Leaderboard gap

Goal: You have three scores: 12, 18 and 15. Display the top score, then display the second-highest score, and finally display how many points the second-highest would need to match the top.

Hint: You may use `max` and `min` together in a clever way to isolate the second place without sorting.

Expected output (for these values):

```
18
15
3
```

### 3. Reassign using previous result

Goal: Start from `value = 7`. First show the initial value. Then update `value` to be `(value + 5) * 2`, show it, then divide this result by 3 and show the rounded final value.

Hint: Use parentheses when you need a specific order of operations.

Expected output:

```
7
24
8
```

### 4. Randomized reassign game

Goal: Start at zero and perform three random point additions. After each random pick (between 1 and 10) add it to the running total and display the updated total.

Hint: Reassign the total after each random draw and print it each time.

Expected output: three increasing integers; each line is the new total (values will vary).

### 5. Compose a final expression

Goal: With three numbers `a = 5`, `b = 12`, `c = 3`, compute a single result by multiplying `a` and `b`, dividing by `c`, rounding that division, and then adding the largest of the three original numbers. Do this in one assignment and display the final value. Add a short comment explaining why parentheses were necessary.

Hint: Decide which operations must happen first and use parentheses to enforce that order.

Expected output:

```
27
```

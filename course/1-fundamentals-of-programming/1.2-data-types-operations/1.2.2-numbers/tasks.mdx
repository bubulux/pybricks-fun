# 1.2.2.2 Numbers - Tasks

Below are practice tasks based only on the material covered so far: variables and numbers (basic arithmetic, division/floats, reassigning variables, `max`/`min`/`round`, and `randint`). We'll provide a separate solutions article later â€” try these on your own first.

Rules:

- The tasks are can be solved with the things you have learned so far.
- You can use everything from the Numbers and Variables sections, even things we didn't explicitly cover
- So for example you could use the custom math function pill or other predefined functions from the second pill
- But you cannot use anything else from other sections (like conditionals, loops etc.)

## Easy

### Implement

#### 1. Print two variables

Goal: Store the numbers 7 and 13 in two variables and display each on its own line.

Expected output:

```
7
13
```

#### 2. Add two numbers and show the result

Goal: Combine the values 4 and 6 and display their total.

Expected output:

```
10
```

#### 3. Subtract and show both values

Goal: Use two values (20 and 5). First display the result of subtracting the second from the first, then display the original first value again to prove it was not changed.

Expected output:

```
15
20
```

### Predict

#### 4. Predict: basic arithmetic

Code:

```python
# predict the output
x = 2
y = 3
print(x + y)
print(x * y)
```

#### 5. Predict: order of operations

Code:

```python
a = 5
b = 2
print(a + b * 2)
print((a + b) * 2)
```

#### 6. Predict: reassign vs. expression

Code:

```python
v = 10
print(v)
print(v + 5)
print(v)
```

## Medium

### Implement

#### 1. Average of two numbers

Goal: Use two stored numbers (8 and 12) to compute and display their average.

Expected output:

```
10.0
```

#### 2. Add then divide (chained reassign)

Goal: Begin with a number `value = 9`. Show the value, add 11 and show the new value, then divide that new value by 4 and show the final result.

Expected output:

```
9
20
5.0
```

#### 3. Random pick within a range

Goal: Produce a random integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive). Run several times to observe different results.

Expected output: any integer between `1` and `6` (inclusive).

### Predict

#### 4. Predict: chaining arithmetic

Code:

```python
n = 4
n = n * 3
n = n + 2
print(n)
```

#### 5. Predict: division and float

Code:

```python
num = 7
print(num / 2)
print(num // 2)  # integer division may not be supported in the simplified editor; think about what the editor expects
```

#### 6. Predict: max/min combination

Code:

```python
a = 17
b = 9
print(max(a, b))
print(min(a, b))
```

## Hard

### Implement

#### 1. Nested calculation and round

Goal: Starting with `a = 10`, compute `(a / 2)`, round that result, add 5, and display the final number.

Expected output:

```
15
```

#### 2. Leaderboard gap

Goal: Given three scores 12, 18 and 15, display the top score, the second-highest and how many points the second-highest needs to reach the top.

Expected output:

```
18
15
3
```

#### 3. Reassign and round final

Goal: Start with `value = 7`. Update it to `(value + 5) * 2`, then divide by 3 and show the rounded result. Print each step.

Expected output:

```
7
24
8
```

### Predict

#### 4. Predict: very complex nested assignment (derivation required)

Code:

```python
from umath import ceil

a = 11
b = 6
c = 4

# compute several nested expressions and combine them
part1 = round(a / 2) + max(b, c)
part2 = ceil(b / 3) + min(a, c)
final = max(part1 * 2 - 3, part2 + 4) + round((a + b) / c)
print(final)
```

Task: Without running the code, derive the value that `final` will print. Show your step-by-step reasoning on paper or in comments, then run the code to check.

#### 5. Predict: nested math with reassignment

Code:

```python
x = 5
x = x * 2 + 3
print(x)
print(x / 4)
```

#### 6. Predict: combine round, max and arithmetic

Code:

```python
a = 5
b = 12
c = 3
result = round((a * b) / c) + max(a, b, c)
print(result)
```

When you finish these exercises, I can produce a solutions article with full code and step-by-step explanations. Ask for "solutions" when you're ready.

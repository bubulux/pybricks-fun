# 1.2.3 Strings

Welcome to the world of text! If numbers help your robot understand "how much" and "how many," strings help your robot understand and work with words, messages, and text-based information. Think of strings as your robot's way of reading, writing, and communicating!

## What Are Strings?

In programming, a **string** is simply a piece of text - like words, sentences, or even single letters. The name "string" comes from the idea that text is like a string of characters beaded together, one after another.

Here are some examples of what strings can represent in robotics:

- **Robot commands**: "move forward", "turn left", "stop"
- **Status messages**: "battery low", "mission complete", "sensor error"
- **Sensor data**: "red", "blue", "obstacle detected"
- **User inputs**: Names, passwords, or voice commands
- **Display text**: Messages to show on screens or send to other devices

Strings are everywhere in robotics - they're how robots communicate with humans and with each other!

## Finding the String Block in Pybricks

In the Pybricks Code Editor, strings are found in the **Data** section under **Lists and Text**. Look for the special pill block with the default text "abc":

/>

This block is your gateway to working with text in your robot programs!

## Creating Your First String

Let's start with the simplest possible example - storing a piece of text in a variable:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-strings/res/STR-1.2.png"
  alt="Creating a string variable"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
robot_name = "Spike"

# The main program starts here.
print(robot_name)
```

When you run this, your robot will display:

```
Spike
```

Congratulations! Your robot just learned its own name. Notice how we put the text "Spike" inside quotation marks - this tells Python that we're dealing with text, not a variable name or number.

## Working with String Variables

You can store any text in a string variable and use it later. This is incredibly useful for robot programming:

  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-strings/res/STR-1.4.png"
  alt="Working with string variables"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
greeting = "Hello"
target = "Robot"
status_message = "System ready"

# The main program starts here.
print(greeting)
print(target)
print(status_message)
```

Output:

```
Hello
Robot
System ready
```

## Combining Strings (String Concatenation)

One of the most powerful features of strings is the ability to combine them. In programming, this is called **concatenation**. It's like gluing words together to make sentences:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-strings/res/STR-2.1.png"
  alt="String concatenation"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Spike"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"

# The main program starts here.
print(message)
```

Output:

```
Hello, Spike!
```

Notice how we use the `+` operator to join strings together, just like adding numbers! We even added spaces and punctuation to make the message look natural.

## Practical Robot Examples

Let's see how strings work in realistic robot scenarios:

### Robot Status Reporting

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-strings/res/STR-2.2.png"
  alt="Robot status reporting"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
robot_id = "Robot-01"
location = "Kitchen"
task = "cleaning"

# The main program starts here.
status_report = robot_id + " is " + task + " in the " + location
print(status_report)
```

Output:

```
Robot-01 is cleaning in the Kitchen
```

### Command Processing

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-strings/res/STR-2.3.png"
  alt="Command processing"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
action = "move"
direction = "forward"
distance = "10"

# The main program starts here.
command = action + " " + direction + " " + distance + " steps"
print("Executing: " + command)
```

Output:

```
Executing: move forward 10 steps
```

## Important String Rules

When working with strings, keep these important rules in mind:

1. **Always use quotation marks**: Text must be enclosed in quotes ("like this")
2. **Variables don't need quotes**: When using a variable that contains a string, don't put quotes around the variable name
3. **Spaces matter**: "Hello" + "World" gives "HelloWorld", but "Hello" + " " + "World" gives "Hello World"
4. **Case sensitivity**: "Robot" and "robot" are different strings

## Strings vs Numbers

It's important to understand that strings and numbers are different types of data:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-strings/res/STR-3.1.png"
  alt="Strings vs numbers"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
number_value = 42
string_value = "42"

# The main program starts here.
print(number_value)     # This is a number
print(string_value)     # This is text that looks like a number
```

Output:

```
42
42
```

They look the same when printed, but they behave very differently! You can do math with `number_value` but not with `string_value`.

## What's Next?

Now that your robot can work with text, it's ready to make decisions based on both numbers AND words! In the next section, we'll learn about **booleans** - how your robot can use strings and numbers to answer True/False questions and make smart choices.

Strings are the foundation of robot communication. Whether your robot is processing voice commands, displaying status messages, or communicating with other robots, strings make it all possible. You've just given your robot the power of language!

  alt="Print True and False"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(True)
print(False)
```

Explanation:

- We use the boolean literal blocks to get the values True and False.
- Each `print()` statement displays one boolean value on its own line.

Expected output:

```
True
False
```

#### 2. Compare two numbers — solution and explanation

  alt="Compare two numbers"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
first_num = 15
second_num = 20

# The main program starts here.
print(first_num > second_num)
```

Explanation:

- We create two variables with the values 15 and 20.
- The comparison `first_num > second_num` asks "Is 15 greater than 20?"
- Since 15 is not greater than 20, the result is False.

Expected output:

```
False
```

#### 3. Test equality — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
num1 = 42
num2 = 42

# The main program starts here.
print(num1 == num2)
```

Explanation:

- We create two variables with the same value (42).
- The equality comparison `num1 == num2` asks "Are these values equal?"
- Since both variables hold 42, the result is True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 4. Chain comparison — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(20 <= 25 <= 30)
```

Explanation:

- Chained comparison checks if 25 is between 20 and 30 (inclusive).
- This is equivalent to `(20 <= 25) and (25 <= 30)`.
- Both parts are true, so the result is True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 5. Multiple comparisons — solution and explanation

Code:

```python
x = 10
y = 20
print(x < y)
print(x == y)
print(x >= y)
```

Step-by-step analysis:

- `x < y` → `10 < 20` → True (10 is less than 20)
- `x == y` → `10 == 20` → False (10 is not equal to 20)
- `x >= y` → `10 >= 20` → False (10 is not greater than or equal to 20)

Expected output:

```
True
False
False
```

#### 6. Logical operations — solution and explanation

Code:

```python
print(True and False)
print(False or True)
print(not True)
print(not False)
```

Step-by-step analysis:

- `True and False` → False (AND needs both to be True)
- `False or True` → True (OR needs at least one to be True)
- `not True` → False (NOT flips True to False)
- `not False` → True (NOT flips False to True)

Expected output:

```
False
True
False
True
```

## Medium

### Implement

#### 7. Battery check simulation — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
battery_level = 35

# The main program starts here.
print((battery_level > 30) and (battery_level < 80))
```

Explanation:

- We check if battery level (35) is both greater than 30 AND less than 80.
- `35 > 30` is True, and `35 < 80` is True.
- True AND True equals True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 8. Robot command validation — solution and explanation

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.4-booleans/res/SOL-2.2.png"
  alt="Robot command validation"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
command = "move forward"

# The main program starts here.
print(("move" in command) and ("stop" not in command))
```

Explanation:

- We check if the command contains "move" AND doesn't contain "stop".
- `"move" in "move forward"` is True (the word "move" is found).
- `"stop" not in "move forward"` is True (the word "stop" is NOT found).
- True AND True equals True, so this is a valid movement command.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 9. Speed selection — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
battery_level = 25

# The main program starts here.
print("Slow" if battery_level < 50 else "Fast")
```

Explanation:

- The ternary operator checks if battery_level (25) is less than 50.
- Since 25 < 50 is True, it returns the first value: "Slow".

Expected output:

```
Slow
```

#### 10. Temperature and humidity check — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
temperature = 22
humidity = 65

# The main program starts here.
print((temperature < 25) or (humidity > 70))
```

Explanation:

- We check if EITHER condition is true: temperature below 25 OR humidity above 70.
- `22 < 25` is True, and `65 > 70` is False.
- True OR False equals True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 11. Complex logical expression — solution and explanation

Code:

```python
a = 15
b = 25
c = 20
print((a < b) and (b > c))
print((a == 15) or (c < 10))
print(not (a > b))
```

Step-by-step analysis:

- `(a < b) and (b > c)` → `(15 < 25) and (25 > 20)` → True and True → True
- `(a == 15) or (c < 10)` → `(15 == 15) or (20 < 10)` → True or False → True
- `not (a > b)` → `not (15 > 25)` → not False → True

Expected output:

```
True
True
True
```

#### 12. String operations with booleans — solution and explanation

This references the blocks shown in the predict task:

  alt="String operations with booleans prediction"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

Code:

```python
robot_status = "battery low"
error_msg = "sensor error"
print("battery" in robot_status)
print("low" in robot_status and "error" not in robot_status)
print("sensor" in error_msg or "battery" in error_msg)
```

Step-by-step analysis:

- `"battery" in robot_status` → `"battery" in "battery low"` → True (the word "battery" is found)
- `"low" in robot_status and "error" not in robot_status` → `True and True` → True (has "low" and no "error")
- `"sensor" in error_msg or "battery" in error_msg` → `True or False` → True (has "sensor" but no "battery")

Expected output:

```
True
True
True
```

## Hard

### Implement

#### 13. Multi-condition robot status — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
battery = 45
temperature = 28
daylight = True

# The main program starts here.
print((battery > 40) and (temperature < 30) and daylight)
```

Explanation:

- We check all three conditions: battery > 40, temperature < 30, and daylight is True.
- `45 > 40` is True, `28 < 30` is True, and `daylight` is True.
- True AND True AND True equals True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 14. Nested ternary decision — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
score = 75

# The main program starts here.
print("A" if score >= 90 else ("B" if score >= 80 else "C"))
```

Explanation:

- First check: Is 75 >= 90? False, so go to the else part.
- Second check: Is 75 >= 80? False, so return "C".

Expected output:

```
C
```

#### 15. None value checking — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
my_variable = None

# The main program starts here.
print(my_variable is None)
print(my_variable is not None)
```

Explanation:

- `my_variable is None` checks if the variable equals None → True
- `my_variable is not None` checks if the variable is NOT None → False

Expected output:

```
True
False
```

#### 16. Complex range validation — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
value = 42

# The main program starts here.
print((30 <= value <= 50) or (70 <= value <= 90))
```

Explanation:

- We check if the value is in either range: 30-50 OR 70-90.
- `30 <= 42 <= 50` is True (42 is in the first range).
- Since the first condition is True, the entire OR expression is True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 17. Advanced logical combinations — solution and explanation

Code:

```python
x = 30
y = 40
z = 35
print((x < z < y) and (z % 5 == 0))
print((x > 25) or (y < 35) and (z != 35))
print(not ((x < y) and (y > z)))
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. `(x < z < y) and (z % 5 == 0)` → `(30 < 35 < 40) and (35 % 5 == 0)` → True and True → True
2. `(x > 25) or (y < 35) and (z != 35)` → `(30 > 25) or (40 < 35) and (35 != 35)` → True or (False and False) → True or False → True
3. `not ((x < y) and (y > z))` → `not ((30 < 40) and (40 > 35))` → not (True and True) → not True → False

Expected output:

```
True
True
False
```

#### 18. Ternary with comparisons — solution and explanation

Code:

```python
speed = 60
limit = 50
result = "OK" if speed <= limit else ("Warning" if speed <= limit + 10 else "Danger")
print(result)

battery = 85
status = "High" if battery > 75 else ("Medium" if battery > 25 else "Low")
print(status)
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. First ternary: Is 60 ≤ 50? False. Is 60 ≤ 60? True. So "Warning".
2. Second ternary: Is 85 > 75? True. So "High".

Expected output:

```
Warning
High
```

## Challenge

### Implement

#### 19. Robot safety system — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
battery = 30
obstacles_detected = False
emergency_stop = False
system_ok = True

# The main program starts here.
print((battery > 25) and (not obstacles_detected) and (not emergency_stop) and system_ok)
```

Explanation:

- All safety conditions: battery > 25, no obstacles, no emergency stop, system ok.
- `30 > 25` is True, `not False` is True, `not False` is True, `True` is True.
- True AND True AND True AND True equals True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 20. Sensor fusion decision — solution and explanation

Solution (code):

```python
# Initialize variables.
sensor1 = 12
sensor2 = 8
sensor3 = 15

# The main program starts here.
in_range1 = 10 <= sensor1 <= 20
in_range2 = 10 <= sensor2 <= 20
in_range3 = 10 <= sensor3 <= 20

# Count how many sensors are in range (at least 2 out of 3)
count = (in_range1 and 1 or 0) + (in_range2 and 1 or 0) + (in_range3 and 1 or 0)
print(count >= 2)
```

Or a simpler approach:

```python
# Initialize variables.
sensor1 = 12
sensor2 = 8
sensor3 = 15

# The main program starts here.
in_range1 = 10 <= sensor1 <= 20  # True (12 is in range)
in_range2 = 10 <= sensor2 <= 20  # False (8 is not in range)
in_range3 = 10 <= sensor3 <= 20  # True (15 is in range)

# At least 2 out of 3 means: (1 and 2) or (1 and 3) or (2 and 3)
print((in_range1 and in_range2) or (in_range1 and in_range3) or (in_range2 and in_range3))
```

Explanation:

- sensor1 (12) is in range 10-20: True
- sensor2 (8) is in range 10-20: False
- sensor3 (15) is in range 10-20: True
- At least 2 out of 3 are in range (sensors 1 and 3), so the result is True.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 21. Ultimate boolean challenge — solution and explanation

Code:

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 15
condition1 = (a < b < c * 2) and (c % 5 == 0)
condition2 = (b >= 20) or (a == c - 5)
condition3 = not (a > c)
final_result = condition1 and condition2 and condition3
print(condition1)
print(condition2)
print(condition3)
print(final_result)
```

Step-by-step analysis:

- `condition1 = (a < b < c * 2) and (c % 5 == 0)`

  - `(10 < 20 < 15 * 2)` → `(10 < 20 < 30)` → True
  - `(15 % 5 == 0)` → `(0 == 0)` → True
  - True and True → True

- `condition2 = (b >= 20) or (a == c - 5)`

  - `(20 >= 20)` → True
  - `(10 == 15 - 5)` → `(10 == 10)` → True
  - True or True → True

- `condition3 = not (a > c)`

  - `not (10 > 15)` → not False → True

- `final_result = condition1 and condition2 and condition3`
  - True and True and True → True

Expected output:

```
True
True
True
True
```

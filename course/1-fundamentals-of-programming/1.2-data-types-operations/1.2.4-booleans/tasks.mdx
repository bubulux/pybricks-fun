# 1.2.4.2 Booleans - Tasks

Below are practice tasks based only on the material covered so far: variables, numbers, strings, and booleans (comparisons, logical operations, ternary operators, and None). We'll provide a separate solutions article later â€” try these on your own first.

Rules:

- The tasks can be solved with the things you have learned so far.
- You can use everything from the Variables, Numbers, Strings, and Booleans sections
- But you cannot use anything else from other sections (like control flow, loops, etc.)

## Easy

### Implement

#### 1. Print basic boolean values

Goal: Display the two fundamental boolean values on separate lines.

Expected output:

```
True
False
```

#### 2. Compare two numbers

Goal: Store the numbers 15 and 20 in variables, then check if the first number is greater than the second.

Expected output:

```
False
```

#### 3. Test equality

Goal: Create two variables with the same value (your choice of number) and verify they are equal.

Expected output:

```
True
```

## Medium

### Implement

#### 7. Battery check simulation

Expected output:

```
True
```

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 9. Speed selection

Goal: Create a battery level variable (set to 25). Use a ternary operator to choose "Slow" if battery is below 50, otherwise choose "Fast".

error_msg = "sensor error"
print("battery" in robot_status)
print("low" in robot_status and "error" not in robot_status)
print("sensor" in error_msg or "battery" in error_msg)
```

## Hard

### Implement

#### 13. Multi-condition robot status

Goal: Create variables for battery (45), temperature (28), and a boolean for daylight (True). Check if the robot is ready to operate: battery above 40, temperature below 30, and it's daytime.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 14. Nested ternary decision

Goal: Create a score variable (set to 75). Use nested ternary operators to assign a grade: "A" if score >= 90, "B" if score >= 80, otherwise "C".

Expected output:

```
C
```

#### 15. None value checking

Goal: Create a variable set to None, then check if it is None and if it is not None on separate lines.

Expected output:

```
True
False
```

## Challenge

### Implement

#### 19. Robot safety system

Goal: Create a comprehensive safety check with variables: battery (30), obstacles_detected (False), emergency_stop (False), and system_ok (True). The robot is safe to operate if: battery > 25, no obstacles detected, no emergency stop, and system is ok.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 20. Sensor fusion decision

Goal: Create three sensor readings: sensor1 (12), sensor2 (8), sensor3 (15). The system should return True if at least 2 out of 3 sensors read values between 10 and 20.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 21. Smart battery management

Goal: Create variables for current_battery (60), charging (False), and power_saving (True). The system should activate if: battery is below 70 AND either charging is active OR power saving is enabled.

Expected output:

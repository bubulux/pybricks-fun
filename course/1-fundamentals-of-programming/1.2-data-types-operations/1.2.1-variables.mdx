# 1.2.1 Variables

This section covers variables in Python programming. Open a file in your editor and follow along!

## What Are Variables?

Think of variables like labeled containers that hold information you want to use later. You can store different kinds of stuff in these containers - numbers, words, or even more complicated things.

Remember when we added the Prime Hub block during setup? That block has an input field where you can type a name. It starts with `prime hub`, but you can change it to whatever you like.

<img

  alt="Setup block with prime hub variable"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

prime_hub = PrimeHub()
```

This is actually already a variable! The variable called `prime hub` holds a special object that represents your actual LEGO Prime Hub.

We can use this name later in our program to tell the computer "hey, do something with that specific hub."

You probably already figured this out - the `set up` block is where we create variables that our whole program can use.

## How to Work with Variables?

So how do you make your own variables? Easy! Look for the red `Variable` section in the left sidebar of the Pybricks Code Editor. It has a suitcase icon:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_place.png"
  alt="Variables section in Pybricks Code Editor"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

Click on it and you'll see an options bar appear:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_options.png"
  alt="Variables options in Pybricks Code Editor"
  style={{ width: "40%" }}
/>

You'll see two sections:

**Variables** and **My devices**. Let's ignore **My devices** for now - we don't need it for this part.

The **Variables** section lets you:

- Create a new variable → the "data starting at 0" block
- Use an existing variable → the "data" block
- Change a variable's value → the "data set to 0" block

## How to Use Variables?

Let's build a program that prints the number 10 using a variable.

### Create a New Variable

1. Drag the `data starting at 0` block into the `set up` block.
2. Change the variable name by clicking on `data` and typing something new.
3. Let's call it `count`.
4. Set its value to `10` by clicking on the `0` and typing `10`.

Your code should look like this:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_set_count.png"
  alt="Variable count set to 10"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

prime_hub = PrimeHub()

count = 10

```

### Use an Existing Variable

Now let's print our variable's value. Variables look like pills in Pybricks, and any block that can use a variable has a pill-shaped input spot. That's how you know where variables can go! The print block is one of these.

First, add a print statement to the `program` block. We did this in the setup section - you'll find it under the blue `output` section, it's the second-to-last block.

Once you add the print statement, notice the pill-shaped input:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_print_placeholder.png"
  alt="With print statement"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

prime_hub = PrimeHub()

count = 10

print("abc")
```

Now drag the `count` block from the **Variables** section into that pill-shaped spot in the print statement.

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_drag.png"
  alt="Drag count variable into print statement"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

Note that at later stage you might have multiple variables. In that case you can click on the variable block in your code to open a dropdown menu and select the variable you want to use:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_dropdown.png"
  alt="Variable dropdown menu"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

So your final code should look like this:

<img
  src="1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_ref_count.png"
  alt="Final variable code"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

prime_hub = PrimeHub()

count = 10

print(count)
```

When you run this program, it prints the number `10` to the console - that's the value stored in our `count` variable.

### Changing a Variable's Value

You'll often want to change a variable's value after creating it. Use the `data set to 0` block from the **Variables** section for this:

1. Below your current print statement, drag in the `count set to 0` block. Change the `0` to `20`.

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_count_reassign.png"
  alt="Set count variable to 20"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

2. Add another print statement below that. Drag the `count` variable into its pill-shaped input (just like before).

Your final program should look like this:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_reassign_final.png"
  alt="Final variable code with reassignment"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

prime_hub = PrimeHub()

count = 10

print(count)

count = 20

print(count)
```

Now before you run the program, think about what it will print to the console. There will be two print statements. Which one is the first and which one is the second?

When you run this program, it prints:

```shell
10
20
```

Did you guess correctly? If not, no worries! Variables take practice to understand. Just remember: when you change a variable's value, it only affects the code that comes **after** the change. That's why we read code from top to bottom, like reading a book. Take a look at the code again, I made some comments to help you see the order:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/res/var_fin_commented.png"
  alt="Final variable code with reassignment"
  style={{ width: "40%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

prime_hub = PrimeHub()

# Initialize variables.
text = 10

# The main program starts here.

# The programm starts - count = 10
print(text)
# The first print statement ran, count is still = 10
text = 20
# Now we reassigned the value to 20, so count = 20
print(text)
# Thus the last statement must print 20
```

## Summary

Variables are like labeled containers that store information for later use. You create them with the `data starting at 0` block in your program's `set up` section. You use them by dragging them into pill-shaped input spots on other blocks. And you change their values with the `data set to 0` block.

Next up, we'll explore specific types of data and what you can do with them. You've already learned about numbers - but there's much more to discover!

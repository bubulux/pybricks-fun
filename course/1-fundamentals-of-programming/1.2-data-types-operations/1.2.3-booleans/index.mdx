# 1.2.3 Booleans - Introduction

Booleans are the simplest answers a program can give: yes/no, on/off, open/closed. Yet they are also the foundation of decision-making. If numbers are the robot's measuring tools, booleans are its questions — and decisions are the answers.

## Goals:

- Understand boolean values and the tiny building blocks (comparison, logical, unary, ternary).
- Predict simple boolean expressions by hand and explain the steps.

Teaching metaphor: Light switches and gates

- Think of each boolean value like a light switch: True means the light is on, False means it is off.
- Comparisons (3 < 4) are sensors that flip the switch based on a measurement.
- Logical blocks (`and` / `or`) are gates that combine switches: `and` only turns on if both inputs are on; `or` turns on if at least one input is on.
- Ternary conditionals are like a small question: "If the sensor is on, give me this; otherwise give me that."

## 1) Comparison block — asking a question

Imagine you're checking the battery level: "Is the battery less than 20%?" That is a comparison. It answers True or False.

```python
# equality and inequality
print(3 == 4)   # Is 3 equal to 4? -> False
print(3 != 4)   # Is 3 different from 4? -> True

# comparisons (greater / smaller / equal)
print(3 < 4)    # Is 3 less than 4? -> True
print(5 >= 5)   # Is 5 greater or equal to 5? -> True
```

Chained comparisons are like asking a multi-step question in one line — "is 3 less-or-equal 4 and 4 less-or-equal 5?"

```python
print(3 <= 4 <= 5)  # True, because 3 <= 4 and 4 <= 5
```

Step-by-step strategy for predicting comparisons:

1. Compute or read the left expression.
2. Compute the right expression.
3. Apply the comparison operator.
4. If chained, check each link in the chain.

## 2) Conditional expression (ternary) — a short if/else

Think of this as asking "If the light is on, give me 1; otherwise give me 0." It's a short, inline choice.

/>

Python mapping and examples:

```python
print(1 if True else 0)         # 1 because the condition is True
print(100 if 3 < 2 else -100)   # -100 because 3 < 2 is False

# nested ternary (harder to read):
print(100 if True else (-100 if True else 0))
```

Classroom tip: Always read ternaries left-to-right: "value if condition else fallback".

## 3) Logical operator block (`and` / `or`) — combining questions

Gates and wiring: If you have two sensors, you might want both to be true before acting (`and`), or at least one to be true (`or`).

  alt="Logical operator block: left and/or right"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
print(True and False)   # False: both must be True to get True
print(True or False)    # True: only one needs to be True

# combine comparisons
print((3 < 4) and (5 > 2))  # True because both comparisons are True
```

Short-circuit note (advanced): Python stops evaluating as soon as the result is known. For `and`, if the left side is False, Python won't evaluate the right side.

## 4) Unary boolean block (`not`, `is none`, `is not none`) — flipping and checking

`not` flips a switch. `is None` checks whether a slot is empty.

  alt="Unary boolean block: not / is none / is not none"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
print(not True)        # False (flip True to False)

value = None
print(value is None)     # True
print(value is not None) # False
```

Teacher hint: Use `is None` to test whether a variable has no value yet — it's safer than comparing to `None` with `==` in some contexts.

---

## 5) Boolean & None literals — the ingredients

These are the basic building blocks: `True`, `False`, and `None` (nothing).

print(False)
print(None)
```

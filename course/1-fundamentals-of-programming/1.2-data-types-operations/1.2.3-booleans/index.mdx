# 1.2.3.1 Booleans - Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of True and False - the foundation of all decision-making in programming! If numbers tell your robot "how much" and "how many," booleans tell your robot "yes or no" and help it make smart choices.

## Finding the Logic Panel

Just like we found the green **Math** section for numbers, let's locate where all the boolean magic happens. In the Pybricks Code Editor, look for the purple **Logic** section in the left sidebar:

/>

This is your decision-making toolbox - every choice your robot makes starts here!

## What Are Booleans in Programming?

Think of booleans like light switches in your house. A light switch has only two positions: ON or OFF. There's no "kinda on" or "halfway off" - it's one or the other. That's exactly how booleans work!

In programming, we use two special words:

- **True** (like a light switch being ON)
- **False** (like a light switch being OFF)

Here are some real-world examples of what booleans represent in robotics:

- **Sensor readings**: Is the robot touching something? (True or False)
- **Battery status**: Is the battery low? (True or False)
- **Position checks**: Has the robot reached its destination? (True or False)
- **Color detection**: Is the detected color red? (True or False)
- **Safety conditions**: Is it safe to move forward? (True or False)

Booleans are like your robot's way of answering simple yes/no questions about the world around it.

Let's start with a simple example to see booleans in action. We'll print the two basic boolean values to see what they look like:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-booleans/res/BOO-1.6.png"
  alt="Boolean literals True and False"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(True)
print(False)
```

The output should be:

```
True
False
```

Perfect! Your robot now understands the concepts of "yes" and "no." But here's where it gets really interesting - these aren't just words, they're actual values that your robot can use to make decisions!

## Comparison Operations - Asking Questions

Remember how we used arithmetic operations with numbers? Well, booleans come from asking questions about numbers! When you compare two numbers, the answer is always either True or False.

Think of comparisons like a judge in a competition. The judge looks at two contestants and decides: "Is contestant A better than contestant B?" The answer is always yes (True) or no (False).

In the purple **Logic** section, you'll find the comparison block. This block lets you ask questions like "Is 5 greater than 3?" or "Is 10 equal to 10?"

Here are the comparison symbols you can use:

- `==` means "is equal to"
- `!=` means "is not equal to"
- `<` means "is less than"
- `<=` means "is less than or equal to"
- `>` means "is greater than"
- `>=` means "is greater than or equal to"

Let's see these in action:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-booleans/res/BOO-1.1.png"
  alt="Comparison operations"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(3 == 4)   # Is 3 equal to 4?
print(3 != 4)   # Is 3 different from 4?
print(3 < 4)    # Is 3 less than 4?
print(5 >= 5)   # Is 5 greater than or equal to 5?
```

Before you run this, take a moment to predict: what do you think each line will print? Write down your guesses!

The actual output is:

```
False
True
True
True
```

How did you do? Let's break down each comparison:

- `3 == 4` asks "Is 3 equal to 4?" Obviously not, so the answer is `False`
- `3 != 4` asks "Is 3 different from 4?" Yes it is, so the answer is `True`
- `3 < 4` asks "Is 3 less than 4?" Yes, so the answer is `True`
- `5 >= 5` asks "Is 5 greater than or equal to 5?" Yes (equal counts!), so the answer is `True`

### Using Variables in Comparisons

Just like with arithmetic operations, you can use variables in comparisons too! Let's create some variables and compare them:

```python
# Initialize variables.
robot_speed = 50
max_speed = 100
min_speed = 10

# The main program starts here.
print(robot_speed > max_speed)  # Is robot going too fast?
print(robot_speed < min_speed)  # Is robot going too slow?
print(robot_speed == max_speed) # Is robot at maximum speed?
```

Can you predict what this will output? The robot_speed is 50, so:

- Is 50 greater than 100? `False`
- Is 50 less than 10? `False`
- Is 50 equal to 100? `False`

Output:

```
False
False
False
```

This shows how your robot can check its own status and make decisions based on what it finds!

## Logical Operations - Combining Questions

Sometimes your robot needs to ask more complex questions that involve multiple conditions. This is like asking "Is it sunny AND warm?" or "Is the battery low OR is there an obstacle ahead?"

That's where logical operations come in! They let you combine True/False values to make more sophisticated decisions.

### The AND Operation

The **AND** operation is like a very picky judge. It only says True if BOTH conditions are True. Think of it like needing both a key AND a password to open a safe.

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-booleans/res/BOO-1.4.png"
  alt="Logical AND operation"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(True and True)    # Both are True
print(True and False)   # One is True, one is False
print(False and True)   # One is False, one is True
print(False and False)  # Both are False
```

Can you guess the output? Remember, AND only gives True when BOTH sides are True:

```
True
False
False
False
```

### The OR Operation

The **OR** operation is much more generous. It says True if at least ONE condition is True. Think of it like having multiple keys - if any one of them works, you can open the door!

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(True or True)     # Both are True
print(True or False)    # One is True, one is False
print(False or True)    # One is False, one is True
print(False or False)   # Both are False
```

The OR operation gives True in most cases:

```
True
True
True
False
```

Only when BOTH sides are False does OR give you False.

### Combining Comparisons with Logic

Here's where things get really powerful! You can combine comparisons using AND and OR to ask complex questions:

```python
# Initialize variables.
battery_level = 75
temperature = 25
is_daytime = True

# The main program starts here.
print(battery_level > 50 and temperature < 30)  # Good battery AND not too hot?
print(battery_level < 20 or temperature > 40)   # Low battery OR too hot?
print(is_daytime and battery_level > 30)        # Daytime AND enough battery?
```

Let's trace through these step by step:

1. `battery_level > 50 and temperature < 30`

   - Is 75 > 50? True
   - Is 25 < 30? True
   - True AND True = True

2. `battery_level < 20 or temperature > 40`

   - Is 75 < 20? False
   - Is 25 > 40? False
   - False OR False = False

3. `is_daytime and battery_level > 30`
   - is_daytime is True
   - Is 75 > 30? True
   - True AND True = True

Output:

```
True
False
True
```

This shows how your robot can make intelligent decisions based on multiple factors!

## The NOT Operation - Flipping the Switch

Sometimes you want to flip a boolean value - turn True into False, or False into True. That's what the **NOT** operation does. It's like a switch that reverses whatever you give it.

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-booleans/res/BOO-1.5.png"
  alt="NOT operation"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# The main program starts here.
print(not True)     # Flip True to False
print(not False)    # Flip False to True

# Use with comparisons
is_moving = False
print(not is_moving) # Is the robot NOT moving?
```

The output shows how NOT flips everything:

```
False
True
True
```

This is super useful for questions like "Is the robot NOT at the target?" or "Is the sensor NOT detecting anything?"

## Making Choices with Booleans - The Ternary Operator

Sometimes you want your robot to choose between two values based on a True/False condition. This is like saying "If it's sunny, wear sunglasses; otherwise, wear regular glasses."

The ternary operator (also called conditional expression) lets you do exactly this in one line:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-booleans/res/BOO-1.3.png"
  alt="Ternary conditional expression"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
battery_level = 30

# The main program starts here.
print(1 if True else 0)                           # Simple choice
print("Fast" if battery_level > 50 else "Slow")  # Speed based on battery
print(100 if 3 < 2 else -100)                    # Math condition
```

Let's read these out loud:

1. "Print 1 if True, otherwise print 0" → Prints 1
2. "Print 'Fast' if battery is over 50, otherwise print 'Slow'" → Prints "Slow" (30 is not > 50)
3. "Print 100 if 3 < 2, otherwise print -100" → Prints -100 (3 < 2 is False)

Output:

```
1
Slow
-100
```

This pattern is perfect for making quick either/or decisions in your robot programs!

## Advanced Boolean Concepts - Chaining Comparisons

Here's something really cool: you can chain multiple comparisons together, just like in math class when you write "1 < x < 10"!

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.2-data-types-operations/1.2.3-booleans/res/BOO-1.2.png"
  alt="Chained comparisons"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

```python
# Initialize variables.
sensor_value = 45

# The main program starts here.
print(0 < sensor_value < 100)      # Is sensor value between 0 and 100?
print(10 <= sensor_value <= 50)    # Is sensor value between 10 and 50 (inclusive)?
print(3 <= 4 <= 5)                 # Is 4 between 3 and 5?
```

Let's trace through these:

1. `0 < 45 < 100` → Is 45 between 0 and 100? True
2. `10 <= 45 <= 50` → Is 45 between 10 and 50 (including endpoints)? True
3. `3 <= 4 <= 5` → Is 4 between 3 and 5? True

Output:

```
True
True
True
```

This is perfect for checking if sensor readings are within acceptable ranges!

## Working with None - The "Nothing" Value

Sometimes in programming, you need to represent "nothing" or "no value yet." That's where **None** comes in. Think of it like an empty box - it's not True or False, it's just... nothing.

```python
# Initialize variables.
sensor_reading = None  # No reading yet

# The main program starts here.
print(sensor_reading)
print(sensor_reading is None)      # Is it nothing?
print(sensor_reading is not None)  # Is it something?
```

Output:

```
None
True
False
```

This is useful when your robot is waiting for sensor data or hasn't made a measurement yet.

## Summary - Your Boolean Mastery Journey

Congratulations! You've just learned the fundamental building blocks of decision-making in programming. Let's recap what you now know:

**The Basics:**

- Booleans are either True or False - like light switches that are ON or OFF
- They represent yes/no answers that help your robot make decisions
- Every comparison between numbers results in a boolean value

**Comparison Operations:**

- You can ask questions like "Is A greater than B?" using symbols like `>`, `<`, `==`, etc.
- These comparisons always give you True or False answers
- You can use variables in comparisons to check your robot's status

**Logical Operations:**

- **AND** requires both conditions to be True (picky judge)
- **OR** only needs one condition to be True (generous judge)
- **NOT** flips True to False and False to True (switch flipper)
- You can combine multiple comparisons to ask complex questions

**Advanced Tools:**

- Ternary operators let you choose between two values based on a condition
- Chained comparisons help you check if values are within ranges
- None represents "nothing" and can be checked with `is None`

**The Big Picture:**
Think of booleans as your robot's decision-making brain. Every time your robot needs to choose what to do next - turn left or right, speed up or slow down, continue or stop - it uses boolean logic to decide.

As you continue your programming journey, you'll discover that booleans are the foundation of all intelligence in programming. From simple sensor checks to complex AI decisions, it all starts with True and False!

**Next up:** We'll explore how to use these boolean decisions to control what your robot actually does using branching and conditional statements. Get ready to make your robot truly smart!

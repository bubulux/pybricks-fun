# 1.2.3.2 Booleans - Tasks

Below are practice tasks based only on the material covered so far: variables, numbers, and booleans (comparisons, logical operations, ternary operators, and None). We'll provide a separate solutions article later â€” try these on your own first.

Rules:

- The tasks can be solved with the things you have learned so far.
- You can use everything from the Variables, Numbers, and Booleans sections
- But you cannot use anything else from other sections (like control flow, loops, etc.)

## Easy

### Implement

#### 1. Print basic boolean values

Goal: Display the two fundamental boolean values on separate lines.

Expected output:

```
True
False
```

#### 2. Compare two numbers

Goal: Store the numbers 15 and 20 in variables, then check if the first number is greater than the second.

Expected output:

```
False
```

#### 3. Test equality

Goal: Create two variables with the same value (your choice of number) and verify they are equal.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 4. Chain comparison

Goal: Check if the number 25 is between 20 and 30 (inclusive) using a chained comparison.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 5. Multiple comparisons

What will this code print?

```python
x = 10
y = 20
print(x < y)
print(x == y)
print(x >= y)
```

#### 6. Logical operations

What will this code print?

```python
print(True and False)
print(False or True)
print(not True)
print(not False)
```

## Medium

### Implement

#### 7. Battery check simulation

Goal: Create a battery level variable (set it to 35) and check if it's both greater than 30 AND less than 80.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 8. Sensor range validation

Goal: Simulate a sensor reading (set to 45) and check if it's outside the valid range of 10 to 50 using logical operations.

Expected output:

```
False
```

#### 9. Speed selection

Goal: Create a battery level variable (set to 25). Use a ternary operator to choose "Slow" if battery is below 50, otherwise choose "Fast".

Expected output:

```
Slow
```

#### 10. Temperature and humidity check

Goal: Create temperature (22) and humidity (65) variables. Check if EITHER the temperature is below 25 OR the humidity is above 70.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 11. Complex logical expression

What will this code print?

```python
a = 15
b = 25
c = 20
print((a < b) and (b > c))
print((a == 15) or (c < 10))
print(not (a > b))
```

#### 12. Chained comparisons with variables

What will this code print?

```python
min_val = 5
sensor = 12
max_val = 20
print(min_val < sensor < max_val)
print(0 <= sensor <= 10)
```

## Hard

### Implement

#### 13. Multi-condition robot status

Goal: Create variables for battery (45), temperature (28), and a boolean for daylight (True). Check if the robot is ready to operate: battery above 40, temperature below 30, and it's daytime.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 14. Nested ternary decision

Goal: Create a score variable (set to 75). Use nested ternary operators to assign a grade: "A" if score >= 90, "B" if score >= 80, otherwise "C".

Expected output:

```
C
```

#### 15. None value checking

Goal: Create a variable set to None, then check if it is None and if it is not None on separate lines.

Expected output:

```
True
False
```

#### 16. Complex range validation

Goal: Create a value variable (set to 42). Check if it's in the range 30-50 OR in the range 70-90 using logical operations.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 17. Advanced logical combinations

What will this code print?

```python
x = 30
y = 40
z = 35
print((x < z < y) and (z % 5 == 0))
print((x > 25) or (y < 35) and (z != 35))
print(not ((x < y) and (y > z)))
```

#### 18. Ternary with comparisons

What will this code print?

```python
speed = 60
limit = 50
result = "OK" if speed <= limit else ("Warning" if speed <= limit + 10 else "Danger")
print(result)

battery = 85
status = "High" if battery > 75 else ("Medium" if battery > 25 else "Low")
print(status)
```

## Challenge

### Implement

#### 19. Robot safety system

Goal: Create a comprehensive safety check with variables: battery (30), obstacles_detected (False), emergency_stop (False), and system_ok (True). The robot is safe to operate if: battery > 25, no obstacles detected, no emergency stop, and system is ok.

Expected output:

```
True
```

#### 20. Sensor fusion decision

Goal: Create three sensor readings: sensor1 (12), sensor2 (8), sensor3 (15). The system should return True if at least 2 out of 3 sensors read values between 10 and 20.

Expected output:

```
True
```

### Predict

#### 21. Ultimate boolean challenge

What will this code print?

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 15
condition1 = (a < b < c * 2) and (c % 5 == 0)
condition2 = (b >= 20) or (a == c - 5)
condition3 = not (a > c)
final_result = condition1 and condition2 and condition3
print(condition1)
print(condition2)
print(condition3)
print(final_result)
```

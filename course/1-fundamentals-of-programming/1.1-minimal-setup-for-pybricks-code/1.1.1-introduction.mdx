# 1.1.1 Introduction

Let's get your computer ready so you can start programming! This section will show you how to set everything up and explain your options.

## What We're Setting Up

You could technically use any Python setup to learn programming basics, but we want you to get comfortable with Pybricks too. So we'll create a simple setup that lets you:

- Write Python code
- Run it using the Pybricks code editor
- Get familiar with how Pybricks works

## What You'll Need

This course assumes you have a **LEGO SPIKE Prime Set**, which comes with a LEGO Prime Hub (the "brain" of your robot).

**Don't have a Prime Set?** You can still follow along! Any hub that works with Pybricks will do for this programming section. Just keep in mind that starting from Part 2 (Fundamentals of Robotics), you'll need the full Prime Set to do the robot exercises.

## Two Setup Options

You have two ways to get started:

### Option 1: Pybricks Code Editor (Recommended for Beginners)

This is the easiest way to start. You'll write and run code directly in your web browser using Pybricks' online editor. Perfect if you're new to programming! It features:

1. A Scratch-like interface with blocks and drag-and-drop functionality to make coding more visual and beginner-friendly - but this feature requires a license.
2. If you dont want to use this interface you can still opt out and use a integrated editor with code autocompletion (which actually is VS Code)

**Choose this if:** You want the simplest setup and want to focus on learning programming concepts.

→ **Continue to: 1.1.2 Getting Started with Pybricks Code**

### Option 2: VSCode + Pybricks (For More Experience)

This uses a professional code editor (VSCode) on your computer with a native Pybricks environment. The Pybricks Code Editor actually has all the features you need to program your robot! But if you prefer traditional text-based coding over the visual block interface and want to start writing actual Python code right away, this option is for you.

**Choose this if:** You're already comfortable with computers and want to use professional programming tools from the start.

## Ready to Go?

Pick the option that feels right for you and let's get coding!

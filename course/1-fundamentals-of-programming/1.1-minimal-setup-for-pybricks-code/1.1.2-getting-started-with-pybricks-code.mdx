# 1.1.2 Getting Started with Pybricks Code

Welcome! In this lesson, you'll learn how to start coding with Pybricks. We'll use the blocks editor (which needs a license), but don't worry—if you don't have one, you can still follow along using the regular Python editor. We'll always show both block and Python code examples, so you won't miss out!

## Connecting a Prime Hub

Let's get your robot ready! First, go to [Pybricks Code](https://code.pybricks.com/). Follow the steps there to set up your Prime Hub. If you're on Windows, you might need to install a special driver, and everyone needs to update the robot's firmware (that's like its brain software).

Click on "Install Pybricks Firmware" and follow the instructions. Come back here when you're done!

  alt="Firmware setup instructions"
  style={{ width: "30%" }}
/>

After that, connect your hub to Pybricks Code using the Bluetooth button:

  alt="Bluetooth connect button"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

Now you're ready to write your first Python program! (You don't need to use Pybricks to run Python, but it's a super easy way to get started, especially with this editor and see your results right away. Just remember: Pybricks Code only works if your hub is connected.)

You can use any hub for this course, not just the Prime Hub.

## Hello World

Let's write your very first program! It's called "Hello World" and all it does is show the message "Hello World" on the screen. This is a classic way to test if everything is working.

### Create a file

First, you need to make a new file. (A file is just a place to save your code.) Click the plus icon and name your file `hello_world`:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/file_create_ic.png"
  alt="Create new file icon"
  style={{ width: "30%" }}
/>

Now, choose if you want to use the block editor or the Python code editor. We'll show you both ways!

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/file_create.png"
  alt="Choose file type"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

If you make a block file, you'll see something like this:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/hello_world_bare.png"
  alt="Empty block file"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

Here's the code for your first program:

```python
print('Hello, Pybricks!')
```

When you make a regular Python file, it might look like this at first:

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub
from pybricks.pupdevices import Motor, ColorSensor, UltrasonicSensor, ForceSensor
from pybricks.parameters import Button, Color, Direction, Port, Side, Stop
from pybricks.robotics import DriveBase
from pybricks.tools import wait, StopWatch
```

You can delete all of that and just use the code we give you in the examples.

That's it! Your whole program is just one line. Let's see what else is in a Python file.

### The Setup Block

Even if you use the Python editor, it's helpful to think about your code in "blocks." Each block has a job in your program.

The "Setup" block is where you get your devices (like your hub) ready. You can also set up variables here (we'll talk more about those later).

For now, let's add the hub as an example. Click the gray area on the left sidebar that says "Setup."

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/find_hub.png"
  alt="Find Prime Hub in sidebar"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

Find your hub (we're using the Prime Hub). Click and drag it under the setup block. It will snap in place, just like LEGO bricks!

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/use_hub.png"
  alt="Drag Prime Hub to setup"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

Your program should look like this:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/hello_world_hub.png"
  alt="Hello World with hub block"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

# Set up all devices.
prime_hub = PrimeHub()

# The main program starts here.
print('Hello, Pybricks!')
```

Great job! You've set up your Prime Hub. We won't use it much more in this part of the course, but you might see it pop up sometimes. You can usually ignore it for now.

### The Program Block

The "Program" block is where your main code goes. Right now, it just has a print statement, but soon you'll add more commands to make your robot do cool things!

Just like before, you can add or remove blocks here. To remove a block, hold it until you see a white border, then press delete or drag it away (into the sidebar...).

Now, click the blue "output" option in the sidebar and scroll all the way down:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/print.png"
  alt="Print block in sidebar"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Drag the print block into the program block. Click where it says "abc" and type your message. For this lesson, type: "Hello World"

<img
  src="/res/hello_world.png"
  alt="Hello World block example"
  style={{ width: "25%" }}
/>

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub

# Set up all devices.
prime_hub = PrimeHub()

# The main program starts here.
print('Hello World')
```

That's it! Now let's run your program and see what happens. First, you might need to show the console (where your output appears). It's a little hidden—pull up the slider at the bottom:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/console.png"
  alt="Show console slider"
  style={{ width: "75%" }}
/>

You should see a black area like this:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/console-up.png"
  alt="Console open"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Now, run your program by clicking the play button:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/run_button.png"
  alt="Run button"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

If everything worked, your output should look like this:

<img
  src="/1-fundamentals-of-programming/1.1-minimal-setup-for-pybricks-code/res/output.png"
  alt="Hello World output"
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

Congratulations! You just ran your first Python program!

### Extra Note: What Are Those Weird Words in Python Code?

1. **What's with the "import" lines?**

- These are called "import statements." They bring in extra tools for your code. Pybricks is a special library (a collection of code) that helps you control your robot.

2. **Why can we just use `print`?**

- `print` is a command that's built into Python. It lets you show messages on the screen. You don't need to import it—it's always ready to use!

3. **What are the green words with # in front?**

- Anything after a `#` is a comment. Comments are notes for humans, not for the computer. They're often green and help explain what the code does. Always read them—they're there to help you!

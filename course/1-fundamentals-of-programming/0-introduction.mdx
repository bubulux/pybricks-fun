# 0. Introduction

Welcome to **Fundamentals of Programming**! This part of the course will teach you the basic ideas behind programming that work with any programming language.

## Why Start Here?

Programming is really about solving problems step by step, like following a recipe or giving directions to a friend. We'll use Pybricks (which lets you program robots with Python) to learn, but these skills work everywhere:

- **Breaking down problems**: Taking big challenges and splitting them into smaller, easier pieces
- **Thinking logically**: Understanding what happens when you run each line of code
- **Spotting patterns**: Recognizing when you've seen similar problems before
- **Building step-by-step**: Creating programs piece by piece in an organized way

**Heads up**: Even if you're excited to jump straight into building robots, learning these basics first will make everything else way easier and faster to understand!

## What You'll Learn

We'll go through four important programming ideas in order:

### 1. Getting Pybricks Ready

First things first—you need a place to write and test your code! We'll set up everything you need so you can focus on learning instead of fixing computer problems.

### 2. Data Types and Operations

Programs work with different kinds of information, like numbers, words, and true/false answers. You'll learn how computers handle this information and how to do things like math, comparisons, and working with text.

### 3. Control Flow

Real programs need to make choices and repeat things. You'll learn the three main ways programs can run: doing things in order, making decisions (like "if this, then that"), and repeating actions (loops).

### 4. Tasks (Functions)

When your programs get bigger, you need ways to organize your code and avoid repeating yourself. Tasks (what Pybricks calls functions) let you group code together and use it over and over again—kind of like creating your own custom commands.

## How You'll Learn

Each topic builds on the one before it, so it's best to go through them in order. You'll see examples, try things out yourself, and gradually build up your programming toolkit. By the end, you'll be thinking like a programmer no matter what you want to build next!

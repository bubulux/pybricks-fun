# 0. Introduction

Welcome to the first part of the course: Fundamentals of Programming! For for convenience reasons we will rely on the pybricks ecosystem. So this is also a good way to start with pybricks and associated tools.

But, and that is very important to note: The concepts you will learn here will be taught in a general way that dont depend on python, pybricks or robotics. The knowledge you gain here is meant to give you an idea how to solve problems with programming in general.

If you are neither familiar with pybricks nor with programming, it is recommended to start with this part of the course. Even doing it the fast way, you will learn a lot of useful concepts that will help you in the rest of the course.

Lets talk next about the content of this part of the course.

## Content

1. **Minimal setup for pybricks code**: First we must make sure you have a working setup to run pybricks code. This will give you a simple and reliable way to run pybricks code on your computer.

2. **Data types and operations**: Here we will learn about the basic building blocks of programming: Data types and operations.

3. **Control flow**: In this section we will learn how to control the flow of a program. You will learn about how to make decisions in your code, how to repeat code and how to wait for events.

4. **Tasks**: Tasks are pybricks way of specifying so called "functions". Functions are a way to group code together and make it reusable. You will learn how to define and use functions.
